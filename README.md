# Bot_detection
Bot detection using email addresses involves identifying fraudulent or spammy accounts created by automated bots using email addresses. This process typically involves analyzing various features of the email address, such as the domain name, format, and age, to determine if it is likely to be associated with a legitimate user or a bot.

 ABOUT THE DATA:
•	The train data set contains the 17 columns and 1321188 rows, and the dataset.
•	There are 11 numerical and 6 categorical variables in data.
•	The target variable is ISBOT, which is not a continuous feature. Which means this is a classification problem.

 DATASET AND DOMAIN:
Here is a data dictionary for the Kaggle bot account detection dataset: 
•	Unnamed: 0: A unique identifier for each row in the dataset.
•	NAME: The name associated with the Kaggle account.
•	GENDER: The gender associated with the Kaggle account.
•	EMAIL_ID: The email address associated with the Kaggle account.
•	IS_GLOGIN: A binary variable indicating whether the account was created using a Google login (1) or not (0).
•	FOLLOWER_COUNT: The number of followers associated with the Kaggle account.
•	FOLLOWING_COUNT: The number of users the Kaggle account is following.
•	DATASET_COUNT: The number of datasets uploaded by the Kaggle account.
•	CODE_COUNT: The number of codes uploaded by the Kaggle account.
•	DISCUSSION_COUNT: The number of discussions participated in by the Kaggle account
•	AVG_NB_READ_TIME_MIN: The average number of minutes the Kaggle account spends reading notebooks.
•	REGISTRATION_IPV4: The IP address associated with the Kaggle account registration.
•	REGISTRATION_LOCATION: The location associated with the Kaggle account registration.
•	TOTAL_VOTES_GAVE_NB: The total number of votes given by the Kaggle account on notebooks.
•	TOTAL_VOTES_GAVE_DS: The total number of votes given by the Kaggle account on datasets.
•	TOTAL_VOTES_GAVE_DC: The total number of votes given by the Kaggle account on discussions.
•	ISBOT: A binary variable indicating whether the Kaggle account is a bot (1) or not (0).


The above data dictionary provides information about the columns in the dataset, including the data type and a brief description of each variable. It is helpful for understanding the dataset and performing data preprocessing and analysis

Following is the variable categorization for the Kaggle bot account detection dataset:

 NUMERIC VARIABLES:
•	Unnamed: 0
•	IS_GLOGIN
•	FOLLOWER_COUNT
•	FOLLOWING_COUNT
•	DATASET_COUNT
•	CODE_COUNT
•	DISCUSSION_COUNT
•	AVG_NB_READ_TIME_MIN
